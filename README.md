# Problem Description
Our NFL database was created as a representation of a database that would aid the leaders or administrators of the football league to make critical, impactful decisions about the league, and facilitate management. It is comprised of key categories of information including the stadium, game, team, players, head coach, and tickets. The NFL is one of the biggest players in a huge sports and entertainment industry, and there is a huge amount of data that needs to be organized, managed, and utilized. Sports leagues constantly undergo change in response to unfair treatment of players, exploitation of rules by players and teams, or changing tastes of consumers. With our database, the league managers and its committees can interpret information to make informed decisions for the integrity, sustainability, and profitability of the league, along with handling the tasks they are responsible for, including creating or changing rules, approving ownership changes, training game officials, integrating technology, ensuring competitive balance, and maintaining legitimacy and entertainment of the game.

This data model outlines the structure of our sports management system, capturing key entities and their relationships. Starting with the stadium, it stores details about the location, capacity, and year built. It’s also linked to the game entity, showing where each game is played.
The game table captures game specifics like date, score, and the winning team. It connects the stadium and the team entities, linking the venue and participating teams. Additionally, it relates to tickets, tracking sales for each event.
The team entity holds information on the team’s founding date, wins, and losses. It’s connected to players and the head coach, creating a clear hierarchy of team composition.
Players are associated with a specific team and include personal details like name and position.
The head coach entity tracks the coach’s name and tenure, directly linking to the team they lead.
Tickets provide details on seat numbers, prices, and types. They link back to the game, stadium, and teams involved, to have a comprehensive event tracking.
