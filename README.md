# Problem Description
Our NFL database was created as a representation of a database that would aid the leaders or administrators of the football league to make critical, impactful decisions about the league, and facilitate management. It is comprised of key categories of information including the stadium, game, team, players, head coach, and tickets. The NFL is one of the biggest players in a huge sports and entertainment industry, and there is a huge amount of data that needs to be organized, managed, and utilized. Sports leagues constantly undergo change in response to unfair treatment of players, exploitation of rules by players and teams, or changing tastes of consumers. With our database, the league managers and its committees can interpret information to make informed decisions for the integrity, sustainability, and profitability of the league, along with handling the tasks they are responsible for, including creating or changing rules, approving ownership changes, training game officials, integrating technology, ensuring competitive balance, and maintaining legitimacy and entertainment of the game.
